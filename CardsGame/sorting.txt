In the first trial the change was that the ace came at first while the other numbers where above 
it.


After using the bubble sore on both of the classes and using the 2 versions the first list made a
slight difference in the position of the jack and the queen by switching them and that shows that
the compareTo in the card class was used however the ace of diamonds although it was an 
othercard class it didnâ€™t change spots and it was still above the queen class


After trying the third version there was a slight difference in the middle also and that shows 
that using difference subclasses will confuse the program when choosing to override a compare too
and this is why it is better to use one concrete subclass for an abstract class that is 
implementing the comparable.
